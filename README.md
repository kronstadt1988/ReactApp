# Extremely fast ReactBuild Environment for Development

This project sets a environment to write React applications. 

Feel free to write React applications under src/js ; gulp will concat all the files into one ( main.js) and transform it to Pure 
JavaScript under build folder.

1- Run node server
2- Run Gulp.
3- After every change it will automatically update build folder very fast. (Which is what we want)
